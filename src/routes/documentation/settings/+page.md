# Settings

Dlool offers many advacned and simple settings.

## Appereance

### Theme

Dlool has a dark and a light theme.
By default the theme will automatically adapt to your systems theme.
At the top of [this page in the settings](/settings/preferences) you can select between _automatic_, _dark_ and _light_. Please note that automatic currently doesn't work in real time but only on reload.
This can also be changed by searching for _Theme_ in the launcher/search.

### Homework

Homeworks which are already due are greyed out. The amount of this effect can be changed using the slider at the bottom.
Setting it up to 100% will result in perfectly readable assignments just as in the early days of Dlool. Setting it to 0% will result in overdue homework beeing hidden. The default value is 50%.
