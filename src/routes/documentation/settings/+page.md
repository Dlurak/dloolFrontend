# Settings

Dlool offers many advacned and simple settings.

## Appereance

### Theme

Dlool has a dark and a light theme.
By default the theme will automatically adapt to your systems theme.
At the top of [this page in the settings](/settings/preferences) you can select between _automatic_, _dark_ and _light_. Please note that automatic currently doesn't work in real time but only on reload.
This can also be changed by searching for _Theme_ in the launcher/search.

### Navigation Bar

By default the navigation shows labels underneath the icons, for experienced users who already know which icons leads to which site,
this may not be as minimal and optically pleasing as they would desire it to be.  
For those users a switch exists to toggle between showing and hiding these labels.  
By default the search _(also known as the launcher)_ can only be started using the keyboard shortcut `ctrl` + `k`,
when enabling the second switch you can also start it with a touch/the mouse from the navigation.

### Homework

Homeworks which are already due are greyed out. The amount of this effect can be changed using the slider at the bottom.
Setting it up to 100% will result in perfectly readable assignments just as in the early days of Dlool. Setting it to 0% will result in overdue homework beeing hidden. The default value is 50%.
