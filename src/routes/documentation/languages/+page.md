# Multi-languag-support

Dlool has excellent multi language support.
Execpt for these docs the entirity of Dlool is available in multiple languages.

## Supported languages

- English
- German

I (author of the docs and maintainer of Dlool) speak German and English, so I can maintain these langauges, feel free to add a new language via a PR.

## Auto-Detection

Dlool tries to use your preffered language by utilizing your request headers.

## Changing the language manually

You can still change the language manually by scrolling to the top of the footer and clicking on the switcher.  
Alternativly you can also open [these settings](/settings/language) and change it there.

## Translating User Generated Content

Using [LibreTranslate](https://libretranslate.com/) Dlool can also translate user generated content.  
You can learn more [here](/documentation/languages/LibreTranslate)!
