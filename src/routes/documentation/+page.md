## Documentation

This is the start of the documentation for Dlool. It is a work in progress. Help via [GitHub](https://github.com/Dlurak/dloolFrontend) is welcome.

The documentation is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
It aims to cover everything, from the very technical parts to easy to understand examples of how to use Dlool.

For the beginning it is only available in English, but we hope to add more languages in the future.
