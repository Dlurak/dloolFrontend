## Documentation

This is the start of the documentation for Dlool. It is a work in progress. Help via [GitHub](https://github.com/Dlurak/dloolFrontend) is welcome.

The documentation is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
It aims to cover everything, from the very technical parts to easy to understand examples of how to use Dlool.
