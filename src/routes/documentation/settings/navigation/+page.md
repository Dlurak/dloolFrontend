# Navigation Settings

These settings can be found [here](/settings/preferences). By default the navigation shows labels underneath the icons,
for experienced users who already know which icons leads to which site,
this may not be as minimal and optically pleasing as they would desire it to be.  
For those users a switch exists to toggle between showing and hiding these labels.  
You can customize which buttons are in which order. By dragging and dropping them in the gray area, they can be removed
by pressing the `x` button two times and readded by pressing the <span class="bg-light-secondary dark:bg-dark-secondary px-2 py-1">Add</span> button.
