## API

Dlool has a REST API. It is completely open and can be used by anyone. The API is documented using [ApiDoc](https://apidocjs.com/). You can find the documentation [here](https://dlurak.github.io/dloolBackend/). I plan to migrate the documentation to this site in the future.
But from now until it is done, there will be a painfull transition period where the documentation is split between two sites.
